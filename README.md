Keil-uVision Embedded Systems Project Built on ARM Architecture

This project introduces a Media Center system featuring a graphical interface on a Color LCD. Controlled through a joystick, the system includes a Photo Gallery, MP3 Player, and Game Center. Users can navigate the menu, view images in the Photo Gallery, play audio files with USB connectivity in the MP3 Player, and enjoy an interactive basketball game in the Game Center. Employing an RTOS for multitasking, this project demonstrates a compact and user-friendly embedded system for multimedia consumption.
